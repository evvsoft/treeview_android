# treeview_android
## Introduction
A view that shows items in a vertically scrolling multilevel tree. It is based on standard android ListView. This differs from the ListView by allowing many levels: groups which can individually be expanded to show its children. The items come from the SimpleJsonTreeViewAdapter associated with this view.

## Usage
The whole project can be included as external android library.
